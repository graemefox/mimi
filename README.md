# 'Multi-individual Microsatelite identification' - (MiMi)
### A tool to improve the design of novel microsatellite panels from genome next-generation sequencing data.

##### What does it do?
MiMi is a script that attempts to build on the microsatellite markers design process [pal_finder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/palfinder/)
by increasing the rate at which markers amplify by PCR and also allows the user to select polymorphic loci from the data.
